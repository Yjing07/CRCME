# CRCME

CRCME is a pathology-enhanced CT foundation model designed to capture microscopic tumor biology from routine CT images. It provides a robust representation for colorectal cancer diagnosis, staging, and risk assessment, enabling comprehensive tumor profiling without invasive procedures.


This repository provides:

    • resources to reproduce and extend CRCME for CRC or related imaging research,

    • tools for developing end-to-end models for non-invasive tumor characterization,

    • a pretrained CT foundation model for downstream colorectal cancer tasks.


## 1. Environmental preparation and quick start

First clone the repo and cd into the directory:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Yjing07/CRCME.git
    cd CRCME
    ```

Using requirements.txt

    • Install the required Python packages using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Using environment.yml

    • Install the required Python packages using pip: `conda env create -f environment.yml`

Activate the Conda environment

    • Then create a conda env and install the dependencies: `conda activate my_python_env`
